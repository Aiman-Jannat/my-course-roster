# React + Vite

Three features of this Assignment project:

- In this Website anyone can enroll courses by seeing the course description.
- Here total credit is 20hr. So, no one can enroll more then 20hr credit.
- Every user can buy a course just for once otherwise it will show a warning.

Sates that i handle in my project:

- At first i used useState for storing all the object that i have created as my fake api.
- Secondly i have used useEffect hook for rendering objects from fake api.
- thirdly i have used another useState for tracking the users who have enrolled courses.
